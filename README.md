#Inter-working between SDN controllers as an OpenDaylight application

##Chapter 1: Learning OpenDaylight MD-SAL

First, you need to learn how to write your application on OpenDaylight.

Read this and write a hello app: [HOW-TO-WRITE-YOUR-ODL-APP](./doc/CHAPTER1.md)

##Chapter 2: Architecture discussion

Architecture discussion for inter-working with your SDN controller: [ARCHITECTURE](./doc/CHAPTER2.md)

##Chapter 3: Sample implementation

I use Hazelcast for this sample implementation: [SYNC-WITH-HAZELCAST](./doc/CHAPTER3.md)

##Homework

This is the end of DIY on MD-SAL, and it is time to summarize what you have done: [HOMEWORK](./doc/HOMEWORK.md)
