#Inter-working between SDN controllers as an OpenDaylight application

##Chapter 1

First, you need to learn how to write your application on OpenDaylight.

Read this and write a hello app: [HOW-TO-WRITE-YOUR-ODL-APP](./HOWTO.md)

##Chapter 2

MD-SAL is basically YANG datastore with DCN(pubsub) and RPC support.

If your SDN controller also follows this kind of data-driven architecture, it is possible to connect your SDN controller to MD-SAL via some kind of gateway:

```
[Your SDN controller]---pubsub(such as Redis)---[GW plugin]<-CRUD/DCN->[MD-SAL]

```

###Data-driven architecture
Usually, SDN controllers internally have datastore supporting pubsub:
- A combination of ZooKeeper and Cassandra
- A combination of Redis and another datastore
- Hazelcast
- MD-SAL
- And many others...

You may also add MongoDB and etcd to the list.

Plugins attached to datastore communicate with each other indirectly via the datastore's pubsub feature.

###The GW's role
- The construct is sort of clustering (ACT-ACT).
- OpenDaylight's CRUD/DCN is seen as MESSAGE on Redis.
- The GW subscribes channels on MD-SAL and Redis for example.
- The GW works as a pubsub relay and data model translator: translation between your data model schema (e.g., defined in your Java classes) and YANG Java binding generated by ODL YANG Tools.
- The data on Your SDN controller's datastore are synchronized with MD-SAL datastore via the GW.
- Users may use both your SDN controller's N.B. API and OpenDaylight's RESTCONF API.
